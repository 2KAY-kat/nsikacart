# Nsikacart Frontend Setup Instructions

This project is an ecomerce rather a market place web app am working on using HTML, Javascript, css and will soon add php and othe tech as it grows.

#### The Main Featues

NOTE: especially in the store front files/market/however you might call it ... some files have function, selectors, and maybe comments that are called checkout and the reason is that the original plan was to have a checkout page like in many other e-cornmercr/market palce platforms and later changed to make it into the now reknowned saved-list page.

#### Reason for the Change

as i did alot of research on online market places i discovered every region/country have their own digital implementations of different platforms be it social media, commerce or any other in that matter.... so i thought it wise to look deep into the MAlawian tech sector and digital adaptability, thats when i realised that most online markets are targeted at certain group of people and Malawians aint the targets 

...

###### WHY

Most malawians dont have a VISA card and Paypal or any other bank to do online payments at least not most... and this is a huge factor considering we are targeting the very population that only got Airtel Money and TNM Mpamba and thats a huge blow.

###### SOLUTION

first ... integrate Malawi's popular mobile payments Airtel Money and TM Mpamba into the market place for payemets ... we have a payment gateway PayChangu ad its somewhat easy to integrate into any market place thats the first.

second ... allow for on get cash pay system.. basically buyers and sellers meet in person and do the transactions on their own

###### DOWN SIDE

not convinient for buyers who just want everything done on the platform

not consistant

not scalable 

not future proof

###### UP SIDE

easy to implement

less code

secure since no transtactions are done on the platfrom and yes

scalable


#### GOALS

work on the payment system with a well planned archtecture just like  i did on the oher parts of the code .

as of now the MVP is a bliss working and yes deployable.
