# STOREDAMBWE
This project is an ecomerce rather a market place web app am working on using HTML, Javascript, css and will soon add php and othe tech as it grows.

#### The Main Featues
* A home page in index.html
* A products page which is typically the store page where to get the products being sold
* There is also some money calculating logic in the Utilities folder and the calculate_cash.js file which helps convert Dollars to Kwachas since its targeting Malawian. So why not Kwacha
* There is a checkout Page which i havent fineshed yet am now working on it will finish it soon just that I have just found a good tutorial on that much later. But anyways its never too late. Right?
* thinking of adding the authentication feature for users to log in obviously also add a database. If you know please work on it and contribute.
